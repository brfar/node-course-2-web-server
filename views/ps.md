## The 'views' folder

'Views' is the default directory that 'express' uses for your templates. 

Templates on handlebars end in .hbs (use 'pug' tho. it's nicer looking)

## The 'partials' folder

A 'partial' is a partial piece of your website, something you can reuse throughout your template. 
To get started the first thing we need to do is set up the server.js file to let 'handlebars' know
that we wanna add support to partials.
